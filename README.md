## How It Works

### 1. Restaurant Discovery

- Uses Google Places Nearby Search API to find restaurants within specified radius
- Filters by cuisine types using keyword matching
- Retrieves detailed information for each restaurant

### 2. AI Recommendation Engine

The recommendation system scores restaurants based on:

- **Rating & Reviews (40% weight)**: Higher ratings and more reviews = better score
- **Review Count (20% weight)**: More reviews indicate reliability
- **Cuisine Match (20% weight)**: How well restaurant cuisine matches preferences
- **Event Suitability (10% weight)**: Appropriateness for the specified event type
- **Mood Match (10% weight)**: Atmosphere alignment with desired mood

### 3. Event-Specific Scoring

Different events have different criteria:

- **Dating**: Prefers mid-to-high-end, romantic cuisines, avoids fast food
- **Family Gathering**: Prefers family-friendly, budget-to-mid-range options
- **Business Meeting**: Prefers quiet, professional, upscale environments
- **Casual Dining**: Flexible criteria, budget-friendly options
- **Celebration**: Prefers high-end, special occasion venues

### 4. Mood Matching

Analyzes restaurant names, reviews, and characteristics for mood keywords:

- **Romantic**: intimate, cozy, candlelit, wine
- **Casual**: relaxed, friendly, laid-back
- **Upscale**: elegant, sophisticated, fine dining
- **Fun**: lively, energetic, vibrant
- **Quiet**: peaceful, serene, calm

## Development

### Project Structure

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # Core business logic

```

### Scripts

- `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript
- `npm run dev`: Run in development mode with hot reload
- `npm start`: Run compiled version
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix`: Fix ESLint issues

### Customization

#### Adding New Cuisine Types

Edit the `cuisineMap` in `src/services/googleMapsService.ts`:

```typescript
const cuisineMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
  new_cuisine_type: "Display Name",
  // ... existing mappings
};
```

#### Modifying Recommendation Logic

Update scoring algorithms in `src/services/restaurantRecommendationService.ts`:

- `calculateRestaurantScore()`: Overall scoring logic
- `calculateEventSuitability()`: Event-specific criteria
- `calculateMoodMatch()`: Mood matching logic

#### Adding New Event Types

1. Update the `event` enum in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add event criteria in `calculateEventSuitability()` method

## Limitations

- **Booking**: Currently uses mock implementation. Real booking requires integration with restaurant-specific systems or third-party services like OpenTable
- **API Quotas**: Google Places API has usage limits and costs
- **Real-time Data**: Restaurant hours and availability may not be real-time
- **Geographic Coverage**: Limited to areas covered by Google Places API
